    <h1>Domains of the Earth</h1>
    <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
    <p>
        The atmosphere refers to the layer of gases surrounding a planet,
        held in place by the planet's gravity. On Earth, it is composed mainly of nitrogen (about 78%),
         oxygen (about 21%), and trace amounts of other gases like carbon dioxide, argon, and water vapor.
          This layer of gases is essential for life on Earth as it provides oxygen for breathing, protects
           us from harmful solar radiation, and helps regulate the planets temperature.

    <h3>Lithosphere</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.google.co.in/" >(google)</a>
        The lithosphere is the outermost layer of the Earth, consisting of the crust and the uppermost
                         part of the mantle. It is a rigid, solid layer that extends from the surface down to about
                          100 kilometers (62 miles) deep. The lithosphere is broken into large pieces called tectonic plates,
                           which float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere beneath them. These tectonic plates are responsible 
                           for many geological processes, such as earthquakes, volcanic activity, and mountain formation. 
                           The lithosphere is crucial in shaping the Earth's surface and supporting life.

    <h4>Hydroshpere</h4>
    <p>
        The hydrosphere refers to all the water present on Earth,
          including oceans, rivers, lakes, glaciers, groundwater, and water vapor in the atmosphere.
           It encompasses all forms of water, whether in liquid, solid (ice), or gas (vapor) state.
             The hydrosphere plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate, supporting life, 
             and participating in the water cycle, which involves processes like evaporation, precipitation,
           It is a key component of the Earth's system,  and infiltration.interacting with the atmosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere.
